This project investigated claims made by Claudia Goldin, winner of the nobel prize in Economics, regarding the gender pay gap.
1. The gender gap tends to widen as individuals age
2. It varies considerably by occupation
3. Non‚Äêlinear returns to hours worked in certain professions drive the gap
4. Other factors
   
As well as recommendations to close the gap. It also investigated external predictions (chatGPT etc) of when the gap will close.

Studying with Datacamp allowed me to be a more confident Data Scientist. I came from Electrical Engineering and this 
allowed me to cover basic python and python for data science in a formal way, detail by detail.  It gave me the tools to do
this project independently and to show very significant insights with simple code. Code is something to embrace, not to fear even if you
are a junior programmer/data scientist.
